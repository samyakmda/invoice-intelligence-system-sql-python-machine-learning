<h2><a class="anchor" id="project-overview"></a>📌 Project Overview</h2>

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning system** designed to support finance teams by:

1. **Predicting expected freight cost** for vendor invoices.
2. **Flagging high-risk invoices** that require manual review due to abnormal cost, freight, or operational patterns.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-objectives"></a>🎯 Business Objectives</h2>

### 1. Freight Cost Prediction (Regression)

**Objective:**
Predict the expected freight cost for a vendor invoice using quantity, invoice value, and historical behavior.

**Why it matters:**
- Freight is a non-trivial component of landed cost.
- Poor freight estimation impacts margin analysis and budgeting.
- Early prediction improves procurement planning and vendor negotiation.

---

### 2. Invoice Risk Flagging (Classification)

**Objective:**

Predict whether a vendor invoice should be flagged for manual approval due to abnormal cost, freight, or delivery patterns.

**Why it matters:**
- Manual invoice review does not scale.
- Financial leakage often occurs in large or complex invoices.
- Early risk detection improves audit efficiency and operational control.

## 📊 Data Sources

Data is stored in a relational SQLite database (`Inventory.db`) with the following tables:

- `vendor_invoice` - Invoice-level financial and timing data
- `purchases` - Item-level purchase details
- `purchase_prices` - Reference purchase prices
- `begin_inventory`, `end_inventory` - Inventory snapshots

SQL aggregation is used to generate invoice-level features.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA focuses on business-driven questions, such as:
- Do flagged invoices have higher financial exposure?
- Does freight scale linearly with quantity?
- Does freight cost depend on quantity?

Statistical tests (t-tests) are used to confirm that flagged invoices differ meaningfully from normal invoices.

## 🤖 Models Used

### Regression (Freight Prediction)
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor (final model)

### Classification (Invoice Flagging)
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier (final model with GridSearchCV)

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV with F1-score to handle class imbalance.
